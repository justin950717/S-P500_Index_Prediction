# S&P500_Index_Prediction
## Masters in DSBA Deep Learning Assignment

This is a Deep Learning case study to compare LSTM vs GRU architectures for stock index time series predictions, using larger time steps.

In recent years, deep learning time series architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have shown promising results in capturing the temporal dynamics of stock index price fluctuations. As such, this study aims to evaluate and compare the performances of LSTM and GRU architectures in predicting the closing price of the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 (S&P500) index. 

On top of that, the architecture that performs better will be further optimized through hyperparameter tuning and regularization to further enhance its predictive performance. Hence, from findings of this study, it was found that the LSTM model architecture outperformed the GRU model architecture, for a larger time step.
